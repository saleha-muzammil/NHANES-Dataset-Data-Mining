# Clustering Analysis on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Dataset

## Introduction

This project aims to apply clustering analysis techniques to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset to identify patterns in dietary habits, physical activity, and their correlations with various health outcomes. Our goal is to provide insights that can aid in the formulation of targeted nutritional guidelines and public health interventions.

The importance of this project lies in its potential to improve public health outcomes. By identifying patterns and correlations between dietary habits, physical activities, and diseases, we can develop targeted interventions and personalized health recommendations. This can lead to a reduction in the prevalence of various illnesses and an overall improvement in population health.

## Mining of Massive Data Techniques with PySpark

We employ PySpark, the Apache Spark’s Python API, to manage and analyze the large-scale NHANES dataset. PySpark is ideal for processing large datasets efficiently across distributed systems with its in-memory computing and extensive machine learning library, MLlib. Here’s how we will use PySpark:

- **K-means Clustering with PySpark**: PySpark’s MLlib offers a scalable implementation of the K-means algorithm, crucial for efficiently clustering large datasets. We will segment the NHANES dataset into groups with similar health and nutrition characteristics, specifying the number of clusters and initialization mode to enhance meaningful segmentation.
- **Bisecting K-means Clustering with PySpark**: Using the BisectingKMeans algorithm, an alternative to traditional hierarchical clustering, we will further analyze and validate clusters formed by K-means, providing a dendrogram for visual examination.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with PySpark**: Employ PCA for dimensionality reduction before clustering to reduce the dataset into principal components, facilitated by PySpark’s MLlib on large datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing and Management**: Prior to clustering, we will implement significant preprocessing steps using PySpark’s DataFrame API, including handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Visualizations and Insights Extraction**: Generate visualizations directly from Spark DataFrames using integrations like Plotly and Databricks notebooks to facilitate immediate insights and interpretation of clustering results.

## Project Objective

- Identify common dietary and physical activity patterns among U.S. populations.
- Discover correlations between these patterns and specific health outcomes.
- Provide a data-driven basis for targeted nutritional guidelines and public health interventions.
